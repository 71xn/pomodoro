**Ideas**
* Have settings menu in a popup modal
* If timer running display current time remaining in the `document.title` property
* Use sliders (or just text fields / plus minus buttons) in settings menu to adjust times
* Use sliders for volume of sounds & checkboxes for enabling / disabling sounds
* Learn how to use localstorage to store user preferences, (and / or google firebase auth for storing prefs. and stats (time worked etc.))
* Todo functionality (clicking on todos to remove (adding animations on hover etc.))
* Light and dark theme switcher
* Ability to set custom backgrounds with different levels of opacity

**New approach to timer worker**

- In main timer code 
  - tick function that calculates the time and decrements when a message from the worker is received
  - postMessage sends a string that contains the key word(start / stop), followed by seconds to count 
- In worker code
  - if message received is start then setInterval
  - if message recieved is stop then clearInterval


### Structure

Shared context, makes use of a reducer to update timer values using a worker thread

Example state structure:
* workTime: `int` stores the time in minutes for the work session 
* breakTime: `int` stores the time in minutes for the break session
* sessionStart: stores a timestamp using `new Date().getTime()`
* sessionEnd: stores a timestamp which is the `sessionStart + work/break time`
* currentTime: stores the current progress of the timer in seconds
* running: `boolean` timer is running or not
* endSound: `boolean` if the end sound should be played or not
* endVolume: `float (0 -> 1)` stores the volume of the bell sound
* clickSound: `boolean` if the click sound should be played or not when pressing buttons
* clickVolume: `float (0 -> 1)` stores the volume of the click sound 
 
### TODO
- [  ] - finish ben awad series on react hooks
- [  ] - setup state and context 
- [  ] - web worker testing, making sure it runs properly 
- [  ] - setup different modes and the ability to change between them
